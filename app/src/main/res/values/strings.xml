reality is a technology that attempts to regenerate computer images and videos to produce real-life visual experiences that are beyond those achieved on the ordinary computer monitor and phone. VR systems do so by using computer vision and advanced graphics to generate 3D images and video by adding depth, and by reconstructing the scale and distances between static 2D images. The user must be able to explore and control these 3D environments using VR headsets lens and controllers which might have sensors on them for users to be able to experience the VR content. For instance, click here for the video that allows you to experience Abu Dhabi in 3D while wearing a VR cardboard headset or directly on your P.C. monitor without a VR headset. Simply click on the video and put your phone inside your VR headset. If you are not using headsets, simply look for the arrows <> inside the video to browse the video in 3D. You can look anywhere around you as you use the headset or the arrows to browse the video in 3D. This is an example of a video taken with VR cameras or 3D cameras. However, modern VR is more advanced than 3D, allowing the user to immerse their five senses into their VR experiences. It also dwells on real-time tracking to enable using VR in real-time explorations.
